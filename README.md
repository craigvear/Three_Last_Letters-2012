## Digital score: A play for musicians: 3 voices, 3 instruments, 3 laptops and diffused soundscape

Demo https://vimeo.com/55203930 

Three Last Letters is a music composition that imagines the last moments in the minds of Scott, Wilson and Bowers before they die in a tent, alone on an Antarctic Ice Shelf in 1912. It was created using facts and suppositions surrounding these last moments and includes a library of found materials created from texts from the final entry’s in Scott’s diary, the final letters home from Scott, Bowers and Wilson, Antarctic field recordings from my British Antarctic Survey composer residency in 2003-4, music materials (specifically We love the place, O God, and Sea Slumber Song by Elgar) and other sounds and music that take the minds of the audience to this lonely place. Together, the mix of the live ensemble with the disembodied voice of Scott, the ghost string sextet, and treated soundscape re-create the immensity of white sonic space of Antarctica, and a claustrophobic sense of being in that tent.

NOTE: These scores are based in software. Although they share many similar properties to that of paper based/traditional scoring methods, they also benefit from the usability and functionality of dynamic software environments. The visual information will be familiar to the musician and welcomed by a curious spirit of adventure. Above all, these scores are responsive, evolving as the performance progresses – giving the feeling of being alive – and should be considered as co-operative creative partners.

IMPORTANT -

1) This score is based in Max/MSP. This must be downloaded and installed prior to operation.

2) Some of the folders contain a document called 'get_files'. These provide a link to media files stored on Dropbox that are required to operate the score. These must be downloaded first and placed in each of the correspondng folders.

## Performers instructions
Three Last Letters is a play for musicians, in so much as each musician has a responsibility to a narrative exposition – however abstract this may be – and approaches the performance embracing the many definitions of the word play (noun and verb). The role of the musician is to contribute to a sense of place within the source material: in this case the last moments in the minds of Scott, Wilson and Bowers as they await death, alone in a tent on Antarctica 100 years ago. Of paramount importance is that each musician enters into the spirit of the piece.
The musician auralises a response through improvisation to the ongoing development of the two scores: the visual and the aural. The objective of the musician is to work in collaboration with all these elements. The evolving composition will be a negotiation between the ears and the eyes, the intellect and the imagination.
Each vocalist and instrumentalist pair will share a computer, but have an individual screen. The computer will generate a visual score from a fixed library containing found materials: text from the final entry's in Scott’s diary, the final letters home from Scott, Bowers and Wilson (respectively), extracts from Sea Slumber Song by Elgar. At times the visual score for the instrumentalist will appear on the vocalist screen. There is a relationship between the pair.
At any given moment, for any given duration a musician’s response can be positioned between literal and abstract associations to the visual and/or aural stimulus. A response can move freely across this range, it can identify with individual elements within the collective soundworld, or the duet relationship, or the fragments of visual information. It can be proactive or reactive; it can be independent or dependent. Alternatively the musician can choose to do nothing.
The visual texts can be read in their original syntax, or as abstract poetry, graphic score, libretto/ lyrics, materials for looping, cut- copy-paste or sampling and sound processing techniques. A change in the on-screen score does not necessarily dictate a change in your response.

## Notes to vocalists
The playing of the text and visual score can involve speech, song, chant or Sprechstimme (sung speech), or a mixture or combination of these. This can include vocal sounds, emotional utterance or language. All sounds must be performed using a microphone. The vocalist must consider where their contribution fits regarding the superfield soundscape: foreground (e.g. sung), midground (e.g. chorus Sprechstimme) or background (e.g. looped speech, utterance, sound effects).

## Notes to instrumentalists
Each instrumentalist is asked to consider their responses from two perspectives: the immensity of the continent and the smallness of the individual human during this tragic event. This is not a request to ‘sound paint’ but to focus an approach within an individual soundworld towards one or the other perspective. This may manifest in a simple duality between extended techniques (multiphonics, sul-pont arco, banks of pedals), and slow/ adagio melodic lines. In any case, the visual score should be considered a common library of notes, inter- relationships (intervals) and harmonic attractors (the DNA profile of something other), and not a post-modern reconceptualization of an established composition.

## Notes on devised rehearsals
The role of the musician is to work in collaboration with all the elements to create a sense of the place within the report. The evolving composition will be a negotiation between the ears and the eyes with the intellect and the imagination. The overall effect should be one of the sensorial not the cognitive. There will be a sensitive line between artistic intent and perceived success as such the realisation of this piece should be developed through a series of devised rehearsals. Although each laptop is given the name, is does not signify that an approach, or ‘characterisation’, be aligned with this name. On the contrary: the wholeness of the ensemble should reflect the wholeness of the situation, the spirit of the music, and the musicians performing.

## Notes on the diffused soundscape
The four stems are not premixed, but present the diffusion artist with a full range of possibilities. As such, these need to be mixed into the ongoing development of the live music. This is especially the case for Katabatic wind and the ghost string sextet stems, which play almost throughout. These two need to be blending within and without the composition so as they generate a filmic sense of space (large continental, small tent, or within the memory of an individual character), and to shift between these states as the music requires.

## Technical setup
1. Each of the performance laptops should be pre-loaded with one of the score parts: Scott, Wilson or Bowers. Each laptop needs 2 screens (its own and an additional VGA/ HDMI)
2. One instrumentalist and one vocalist share each laptop. The screen of the laptop is the score for the vocalist, and the additional screen is for the instrumentalist. It is useful if the vocalist can see the instrumentalists’ screen
3. The soundscape laptop will be connected to the sound system. Multi-speaker diffusion is encouraged. This can be done through a physical desk (digital or analogue) or using the mixer option inside the soundscape app., using either the laptop or a tablet such as an iPad and Mira software (purchased separately)
4. Scott laptop will control the audio for the “voice of Scott” and needs to be connected either to a dedicated speaker positioned within the ensemble, or to the main sound system
5. All sound (live vocals, instruments, and pre-recorded soundscape) should be projected through the sound system
6. The soundscape starts the performance
7. Scott, Wilson and Bowers laptops: on Q from soundscape (roughly
5 minutes) press Start; the score will become full screen; the play
has begun
8. When an individual’s’ part has reached an end the screen will turn
black and reduce to a small size, this is your Q to bring your play to
a close. NB others may still be performing
9. Quit and then reload the apps to restart the composition

## Stage setup
The performance of this music works equally well in the round as it does traditional end-on. In the round: the vocalists stand centrally facing out, making 3 points of a triangle; the instrumentalist sit in front of these. The audience surround the musicians looking in; diffusion speakers surround all.
